### My name is Laurynas and this page is dedicated to my programming journey. 

It all started when I learned VBA on myself and wrote some macros for a SolidWorks CAD software. Doing this for a while made me realise I like to create new functions and see them make mine and my colleagues life easier. I finished a JavaScript Full - Stack course where I worked on my programming skills not only during lectures, but on my free time too.

I continue to actively deepen my knowledge in the programming field on my own and I'm seeking to use my acquired knowledge in practice, extend it further and learn new things from more experienced professionals.

Right now I'm working on my own project, where I use MERN stack, called Price It. It's a simple tool that is used to find the price of a product in different stores.
